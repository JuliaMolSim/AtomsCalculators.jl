# AtomsCalculators

Documentation for [AtomsCalculators](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsCalculators.jl).

This is a calculation interface for [AtomsBase](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/AtomsBase.jl) meant to extend the interface for calculators.
At this moment this is a preliminary version with molecular dynamics and various geometry optimizations
in mid. In the future there can be more functionality too.
